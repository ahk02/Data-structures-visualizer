                <p>A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure where insertion can happen from only one end and deletetion can happen from the same end.
                    A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list
                    <br />The basic operations associated with the stack are push and pop.</p>
                <p>
                    The push operation inserts an element into the stack.
                    The pop operation removes an element from the stack.
                    <br />
                    Stacks are used for converting infix expressions to postfix and prefix, expression evaluation, backtracking etc.
