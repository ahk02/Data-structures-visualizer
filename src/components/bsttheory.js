                <p>It is a special type of binary tree where every node stores a value lesser than itself in it's left subtree and a value greater than itself in its right subtree.
                    <br />The left subtree and the right subtree of a node are also a binary search tree.
                    Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, insertion and deletion of elements.</p>
                <p>
                    The time taken to insert, delete and search for an element is proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements in the binary search tree
                    <br />
                    Binary seach trees are used to implement searching algorithms, to maintain a sorted stream of data etc.
